V2 of Muh Dotfiles
==================

* Fish shell
* Some custom functions
* Oh My Fish.  Tried to use fisherman. Even though it's implied fisherman can
  easily install Oh My Fish plugins, this is not true of the `vcs` plugin.
  I've yet to find a git aware theme/prompt that doesn't use this plugin.
